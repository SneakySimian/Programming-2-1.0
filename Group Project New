// This is what the name of the package is.

/* The goal of our project is to develop a program that determines the cost of attendance. Originally, this included the cost of attendance. 
 * 
 * We narrowed down to cost of tuition to manage our program and get the code  to run.
 * 
 * This program aims to calculate the cost of tuition for a Campbell student based on
 * the number of courses and credits that a student is taking.
 * 
 * Group members: Josiah, Seth, and Samantha.
